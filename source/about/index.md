QBO was created because we knew there was a better way to operate cloud computing. The status quo of accepting performance costs, management overhead, monetary costs, portability limitations, and complexities of VM-based clouds needed to be broken.

Our vision is to transform cloud computing by making virtual machines a thing of the past. QBO empowers anyone to effortlessly operate their own cloud platform anywhere, all while delivering enhanced performance at a fraction of the cost.
