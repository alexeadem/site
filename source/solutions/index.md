Explore the tangible benefits QBO can deliver for your organization</p>

## <i class='bx bxs-brain' ></i> AI & ML

QBO is tailored to the demands of resource-intensive environments, making it an optimal choice for AI and ML workloads, databases, real-time, and low-latency applications. Its commitment to optimized performance ensures that your cloud infrastructure meets the unique requirements of advanced computing applications.

Metal performance is crucial for AI workloads, ensuring optimal performance, scalability, and responsiveness. Direct access to metal resources maximizes computational efficiency and performance outcomes, especially for processing large data sets and complex models.

## <i class='bx bxs-data'></i> Databases

For databases, direct access to disk I/O resources enhances performance by reducing latency and improving throughput during I/O intensive operations. This is particularly beneficial for workloads involving large data sets or frequent data access.

## <i class='bx bxs-time-five' ></i> Real-time & Low Latency Apps

In real-time and low-latency applications, metal performance is essential for achieving fast response times, predictable performance, efficient resource utilization, and deterministic behavior. These factors are critical for meeting the demands of real-time computing environments.

## <i class='bx bx-cloud' ></i> Bring the cloud anywhere

Turn metal into a cloud computing platform. Deploy a fully managed cloud on your own infrastructure, on developer laptops, and in airgapped environments in minutes.
Keep the development light on
Let developers, SEâ€™s, and other technical teams have autonomy over their cloud environments without worrying about costs or turning off or destroying services.

## <i class='bx bx-rocket' ></i> Accelerate CI/CD

Let developers operate faster with a more performant and easy-to-use UI. No more long waits for resource availability and without the struggles of a shared test environment.
